                    <p class="article-p">Bocchi the Rock! teems with experimental animation that captures the social anxiety and catastrophizing the anime’s namesake character experiences. It’s a fun ride. Bocchi the Rock! follows the members of Kessoku Band: Hitari Goto (better known by her nickname Bocchi), Nijika Ijichi, Ryo Yamada, and Ikuyo Kita. Each of the girls fall into different psychological profiles. Bocchi is a neurotic introvert who uses lies to cover her insecurities. Nijika is a cheery extrovert and the glue of the band. Ryo offers another introvert, but she doesn’t suffer from social anxiety; she’s a loner but able to social just fine. Ikuyo rounds out as another extrovert, but unlike Nijika Ikuyo suffers from social anxiety. She’s not at the same level as Bocchi, but her anxiety and insecurities trouble her since she needs social interaction.</p>

                    <p class="news-2-p">In its opening weekend, the Bocchi The Rock compilation film, "Bocchi The Rock! Re:", pulled in around 180 million yen, which is the equivalent of a little over one million U.S. dollars. This marks the highest entry for an anime compilation film outside of Demon Slayer, which is especially impressive considering that the Demon Slayer Corps' films would routinely house new footage from the anime adaptation. </p>
